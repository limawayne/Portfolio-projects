# Masters-projects

Data Science Portfolio – Marketing Analytics
Overview
This is my portfolio of data science projects applied to marketing. I choose 2 projects to highlight the skills I've learned in my masters such as translate business problems into analytical frameworks, apply quantitative methods, and generate actionable marketing insights.

The projects focus on two core areas of marketing analytics:
Predictive Modeling for Campaign Optimization
Competitive Marketing Analysis in the Tourism Sector
Both projects were developed using Python, on Visual Studio and follow a structured data science workflow, emphasizing business relevance, interpretability, and decision-making impact. Although they are group projects, I'd say I did most of the carrying here, with a lot of support of artificial intelligence.
